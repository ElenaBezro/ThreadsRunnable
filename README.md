Mini project

SOLID Principles

Description: Create a mini project that simulates a banking system

Objective: Ensure the banking system is well-designed by adhering to
SOLID principles.

Task 1: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and
Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Sub-Task 1.1:

Break down BankAccount class to separate concerns (SRP) - one
class for account details and another for transaction processing.

Task 1: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface
Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion
Principle (DIP)

Sub-Task 1.2:

Implement additional transaction types without modifying existing
code (OCP).

Hint: Create a Transaction interface and derive Deposit and
Withdrawal classes to satisfy LSP.

Break 10 minutes

Task 2: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface
Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion
Principle (DIP)

Sub-Task 2.1:

Refine interfaces to be specific (ISP) and ensure high-level modules
are not dependent on low-level ones (DIP).

Task 2: Hands-on Project: SOLID Banking System

Sub-Task 2.2:

Iteratively refactor classes, interfaces, and methods ensuring
alignment with SOLID principles.

Test the final system for functionality and extensibility.
