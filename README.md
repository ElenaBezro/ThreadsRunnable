Mini project

Java Util Concurrent and Concurrent Collections.

Description: Create a mini project that simulates a banking system

Objective: Integrate advanced concurrency tools into the banking
system.

Task 1: Executor Framework

Sub-Task 1.1:

Replace manual thread management with ExecutorService to
execute Customer transactions.

Task 2: Concurrent Collections

Sub-Task 2.1:

Replace HashMap with ConcurrentHashMap to store BankAccount
instances.

Task 2: Concurrent Collections

Sub-Task 2.2:

Use CopyOnWriteArrayList to maintain a thread-safe transaction
history.

Task 3: Future for Asynchronous Computations

Sub-Task 3.1:

Modify the Bank class to return a Future object for each
transaction, enabling asynchronous processing.

Task 3: Future for Asynchronous Computations

Sub-Task 3.2:

Experiment with retrieving results using get() and handle potential
exceptions.

Task 4: Hands-on Project: Enhanced Banking System

Sub-Task 4.1:

Test the system under high concurrency and ensure thread safety
and data consistency.
